Basic Golang Notes

*** LOOP
1. There is only 1 key word for looping in Golang, i.e. 'for', and there are 3 different ways for using 'for'
2. 'for condition' is equivalent to a while loop in other languages. Here, the condition can depend on some evolving variable, 
   and the condition will be re-evaluated every time the execuation reaches it.
3. 'for init ; cond ; inc/dec' is similar to the usage of for loop in C++. A re-evaluation of cond will happen every time the program reaches it.
4. The last usage of 'for' is 'for i, v := range slice/array/string'. This is unique in Golang. The 'range' automatically returns the current index and
   a copy of its current variable. The value name 'v' is created once at the beginning and is re-used for later iterations. So obtaining its address will
   result in a same value every time. Either 'i' or 'v' can be a blank placeholder '_'. Unlike [2] and [3], 'range' won't use an updated array. For instance,
   if the array is incremented inside the loop block, the new values are not visible to 'range'. My guess is the 'range' is initialized using the original length,
   and it is fixed. Although the underlying array data does grow, the length doesn't change. So 'range' won't loop over new values. 
   Lastly, there is a short version, 'for i := range array', the variable is the current index not value.
5. (05/20/2020) Just saw a very interesting usage! It seems that using 'q = q[1:]' insider 'for i, v := range array' works. This is different from growing the array.
   The array length used in 'range' still is not changing. What changes is the beginning of the array, which is visible after the block is finished.

*** STRING
1. A string is an array of bytes, i.e. [fixed len]byte. You can convert a string to a byte slice thru []byte(string) or a rune slice thru []rune(string).
2. It can't be modified. Appending a byte to a string doesn't work as it is in Python3. To write a string like a slice, one can use the struct strings.Builder{} provided
   in "strings" package. It functions like a slice of characters.
3. Details of strings.Builder{} and its methods:
   1. to declare and initialize a new variable, use strings.Builder{} (empty);
   2. it has slice-like methods, such as Cap(), Len(), Grow(n int);
   3. 4 write methods allow to write to the Builder{}, they are Write([]byte), WriteByte(c byte), WriteRune(rune), WriteString(string);
   4. lastly, to convert a strings.Builder{} to a string, use the String() method.
